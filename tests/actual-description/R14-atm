description = "Design the software to support a computerized banking network, including human cashiers and automatic teller machines ATMs to be shared by a consortium of banks. Each bank provides its computer to maintain its accounts and process transactions against them. Cashier stations are owned by individual banks and communicate directly with their own bankâ€™s computer. Human cashiers enter account and transaction data. Automatic teller machines communicate with a central computer which clears transactions with the appropriate banks. An automated teller machine accepts a cash card, interacts with the user, communicates with the central system to carry out the transaction, dispenses cash, and prints receipts. The system requires appropriate record-keeping and security provisions. The system must handle concurrent access to the same account correctly. The banks will provide their software for their computers; you are to design the software for the ATMs and the network. The cost of the shared system will be apportioned to the banks according to the number of customers with cash cards."
