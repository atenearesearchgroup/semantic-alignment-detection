description = "A flight reservation system is a commonly used system. Typically a customer places an order for seats in a combination of connected flights from an origin to a destination airport. The customer and the system need to check flight connections' feasibility and schedule. The list of requirements for the reservation system is given below.Flight is defined by a number and a date and defines a route from an origin airport to a destination airport. A plane is assigned to a flight containing a set of numbered seats. Customers make reservations for specific seats on specific flights and have tickets. A route is followed by a flight from its origin airport to its destination airport. The information boards in the airports show short information about the flights, as FB073 flight departed at 08:45. A route includes one or more spans. A span is a part of a route from a start airport to a termination airport as part of a specific flight. The start (or termination) airport is called this span's origin (or destination) airport. For each flight, there are several connecting flights (different flights that leave from an intermediate stop close after their arrival).Stops are not indicated in the ticket unless the flight number changes, which indicates a plane change. An airline is any direct flight between two airports. All airlines are spans of some flights. A basic airline has no stops. A route is a set of connected basic airlines connecting all the airports through which it passes.For the convenience of customers, we may keep information on relevant facilities; for origins, we keep aspects such as parking; for destinations, we list hotels near the airport; for intermediate stops, we provide lists of hotels close to the airport, restaurants, etc. This information may also include details of the cities nearby."
