description = "Library Management System  Purpose The library management system is software that is designed to manage all the functions of a library. Scope  The library management system is software that is designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps the librarian maintain the database of new books, the books that members borrow, and their due dates. This system completely automates all your library's activities.Requirements There is a library officer who will manage the membership processes. A library issues loan items to members. Each member has a membership card that shows a unique member number. Along with the membership number, other details on a customer must be kept, such as a name, address, and date of birth.A bar code uniquely identifies a loan item. There are two types of loan items, language tapes, and books. A language tape has a title language (e.g., Spanish) and level (e.g., beginner). A book has a title and author(s). An item can be borrowed, reserved, or renewed to extend a current loan. A member can reserve a loan item not available at the library. When a book or language tape is returned to the library, the member who made the reservation will be notified. Reservations will be canceled upon borrowing by the member or upon the member's request. The application will allow updating the list of loan items, user registration, lending transactions, and reservations."
