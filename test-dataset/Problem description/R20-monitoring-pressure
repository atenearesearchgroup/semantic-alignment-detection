description = "The system monitors the pressure and sends the safety injection signal when the pressure falls below a threshold. The human operator can override system actions by turning on a block button and resets the manual block by pushing on a reset button. A manual block is permitted if the pressure is below a permitted threshold. The system must automatically reset the manual block. A manual block is effective if and only if it is executed before the safety injection signal is sent. The reset button has higher priority than the block button."
