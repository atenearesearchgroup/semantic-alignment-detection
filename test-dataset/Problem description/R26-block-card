The user can initiate the card-blocking process if the card status is available. During the card-blocking process, the system should ask for the reason for the blocking. The system should display three different kinds of blocking reasons for the user. The blocking reasons can be stolen, missing, and others. If the user selects 'other' as the reason, the system should ask for further explanation in a free-text area. If the user does not enter this area field as input, the system should not let the user block their card. After the user completes the card-blocking process, the system should immediately block the related card, and no one should be able to use that card in ATMs, shopping, online shopping, etc. If a blocked card is used for anything, the system should inform the banking staff and cardholder.
