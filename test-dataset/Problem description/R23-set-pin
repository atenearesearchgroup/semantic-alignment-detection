Both card number and CVV information should be an integer. The system should not accept any other type of input.If the user enters any other type and continues, the system should display an error message, and the process should not continue.If the user enters the wrong card number for the third time, the system should display a pop-up saying that the user entered the wrong card number for the third time and will be logged out. After the message displays, the system should cancel the 'PIN setting' process, and the user should be logged out of the application. Software System  The system should have a parameter on the database that stores whether the user has a pin.After the user enters the card number and the CVV information, the system should perform the check. If the user already has a PIN, the system should display a pop-up saying that the user already has the PIN code. If the user has no PIN code, the system should display the 'Set PIN' flow, the first step. When a user completes the 'Set PIN' process, the database's related parameter value should be true.After the user sets the PIN, if desired, the user should be able to reset and change the PIN.Rules After the user successfully sets their PIN code, they should be able to use it immediately on the kiosk or any transaction requiring a pin.PIN code should never be stored anywhere on the application. It should be directly sent to banking systems via an encrypted tunnel."
