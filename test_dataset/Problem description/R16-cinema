description = "The user selects the movie show for which he would like to book tickets. This he does by clicking on the relevant film or the desired date. Depending on the selection, a list of movie shows for the selected film or movie shows of the chosen day is displayed. Then he clicks on the movie show for which he would like to order tickets. If there are any of the 30 orderable tickets left, he is prompted to enter his name, his e-mail address, and the desired number of cards. He can also specify whether he wants to be reminded of the movie show by e-mail. After a click on the order, the system attempts to allocate the desired cards. If this is possible, a confirmation page is displayed on which all the provided information is summarized again. If the tickets for this movie show can not be reserved, there will be an error message, and the user will be prompted to reduce the number of cards or select a different idea."
