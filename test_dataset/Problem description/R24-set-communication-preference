description = "Menu Placement The Set Communication Preferences process should be under the 'Accounts' menu. It should be added at the bottom of the page.Customer Users should be able to choose if they want to get information via e-mail or SMS. When a user enters the banking system user should see a menu that allows the user to select communication preferences. The screen should display an information message for the user stating that if the user changes the preferences, it will be applied to all the transaction flows and other contact-required processes. Software System If the user has not any e-mail address registered to the banking system, the e-mail option should see as 'disabled', and by default, the SMS option is selected. Since SMS is the only option, the user should not be able to continue the process. If the user has both information (e-mail and telephone number), the user can proceed with the flow. When the user selects e-mail and completes the process, from that point, the bank should only send e-mails for sending information to the customer. Also, if the user selects the SMS option and completes the process, the bank should communicate with the user only via SMS. After the process, the banking system should store this preference in the database. "
