description = "At the beginning of each semester, students may request a course catalog containing a list of course offerings. Information about each course, such as professor, department, and prerequisites, will be included to help students make informed decisions.The new online registration system will allow students to select four-course offerings for the coming semester. In addition, each student will indicate two choices in case a course offering becomes filled or canceled. Each course offering will have at most ten students. No course offering will have fewer than three students. A course offering fewer than three students will be canceled. Once the registration process is completed for a student, the registration system sends information to the billing system so the student can be billed for the semester.Professors must be able to access the online system to indicate which courses they will be teaching. They will also need to see which students signed up for their course offerings.For each semester, there is a period that students can change their schedules. Students must be able to access the online system during this time to add or drop courses. The billing system will credit all students for courses dropped during this period.At the end of the semester, the student can access the system to view an electronic report card. Since student grades are sensitive information, the system must employ extra security measures to prevent unauthorized access."
